# HFFBM_Operator_MADM

### Introduction

The experimental source code of paper Hesitant Fermatean Fuzzy Bonferroni Mean Operator for Multi-attribute Decision Making with Python code. 
The underlying fuzzy logic operation framework adopts mohusets(https://github.com/yibocat/mohusets), a fuzzy sets mathematical operation toolkit of 
q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets, interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets and q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy sets.

### Code introduction


The paper proposes two types of hesitant Fermatean fuzzy Bonferroni mean operators. The code of the BM operator is implemented in file HFFWBM_HFFEWBM.py(https://github.com/yibocat/HFFBM_Operator_MADM/blob/master/HFFWBM_HFFEWBM.py). And the MADM method is presented in the file Proposed_method.ipynb(https://github.com/yibocat/HFFBM_Operator_MADM/blob/master/Proposed_method.ipynb). example.ipynb(https://github.com/yibocat/HFFBM_Operator_MADM/blob/master/example.ipynb) shows the experimental code of all Examples in the article.

In addition, the comparison methods listed in this article have been implemented in Python code.
